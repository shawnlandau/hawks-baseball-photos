   - Verify the user has proper authentication

2. **Check File Type**
   - Only image files are allowed (JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.)
   - File size must be under 10MB

3. **Check Firebase Console**
   - Verify Storage is enabled
   - Check if there are any error messages

## üß™ **Testing Steps**

1. **Sign In**: Create an account or sign in
2. **Upload Test**: Try uploading a small image file (< 1MB)
3. **Check Console**: Look for any error messages in browser console
4. **Verify Upload**: Check if the photo appears in the gallery

### **Current Firebase Configuration:**
- Project ID: `hawksbaseballphotos-5bb61`
- Storage Rules: ‚úÖ Deployed
- Firestore Rules: ‚úÖ Deployed

allow write: if request.auth != null && 
  request.resource.size < 10 * 1024 * 1024 && // 10MB limit
  request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*'); // Images only
allow delete: if request.auth != null; // Only authenticated users can delete
```

3. **Try Different File** - test with a different image
4. **Check Network Tab** - look for failed requests

The CORS issue should now be resolved with the deployed storage rules!
